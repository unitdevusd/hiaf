            <p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on December 27, 2020 03:40 pm Pacific Standard Time. This Privacy Policy applies from said date.

            <p>
                Unit Storage cares about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal information only as needed to deliver services, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you have requested (collectively, our “Services”).

            </p>

                </ul>
            <p><strong>Widgets</strong></p>
            <p>We may use technologies such as widgets or API’s to display parts of our services (e.g., your Listing page) on sites that are operated by our business partners. Listings displayed on a business partners’ site only include the information you provide in your public Unit Listings.</p>
            <p><strong>Information We Share</strong></p>
            <p>Compliance with Law:</p>
            <p>Sharing between Hosts and Renters:</p>
            <p>We may also share information between Hosts and Renters to facilitate the booking process and give you access and control during your renting or hosting experience. Such information as your full name, telephone number, email address, and the address of the Unit to be rented (if you are a Host) will be shared between the two parties upon a confirmed booking of a Unit.</p>
            <p>2. Service Providers:</p>
            <p>Unit transfers data necessary in carrying out your requests, and processing payment information through its vendors. Unit does not transfer any additional personal information to third parties.
Unit cooperates with law enforcement activities, and in extreme cases may pass your personal information upon legal demand by law enforcement. In the event that Unit is acquired, sold, liquidated, or enters bankruptcy, personal information will be transferred to the purchasing or managing entity with the expectation that equal or greater privacy controls will be maintained for all personal information transferred.</p>
            <p>3. Public Listings and Profiles:</p>
            <p>In order to advertise your Listings and assure customer safety, we make certain information available for public access via the Unit services. The information on public Listings and Profiles may include information such as your first name, your description of the Unit, your general description of yourself, the general area in which your Unit is located, a verified ID status (if we have verified your identity via documentation you have provided us), a verified Host status (if you have previously hosted with Unit), and any other information you choose to provide in your public Profile or Listing. </p>
            <p>4. Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</p>
            <p>We may also share aggregated data (data we combine about our users so that it no longer can identify or reference any individual user) and other anonymized data for business purposes such as marketing, market and industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other business practices.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies and Other Related Technologies</strong></p>
